Offers main findings in the SemEval-2019 OffensEval<br>
Related to Toxic Comment Classification Challenge - 5 http://kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge<br>
Difference: text classification problem, as opposed to span identification<br>
Contains list of teams and their system description papers describing their approach<br>
Most popular approach: Deep Learning 70%, Machine Learning 17%<br>
Included techniques: normalizin tokens (e.g. c00l to cool), converting emojis to text, removing uncommon words<br>

Difference: binary text classification problem, as opposed to span identification<br>
Approaches: Logistic Regression (LR), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)<br>
Threshold chosen: equal-error <br>
Also contains information on attack timings - irrelevant to our problem<br>
